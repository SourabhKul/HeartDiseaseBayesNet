- This is the code release for 688, HW 1

- All of the data required for this assignment is in the data/ folder
- The autograder includes numpy 1.14 and scipy 1.0.0 so if you use these packages, make sure to use these versions


- The included files are:
    - demo.py: a short demonstration of the API you must support
    - code/bn.py: this holds your BayesNet class. You will need to implement this.
    - code/queries.py: use this file to answer question 5 
    - code/bn_custom.py: this holds your answer to question 8. The API is identical to the BayesNet class

Submission instructions:
    - Once you are ready to submit, zip the code directory to create a code.zip file
    - Other bundling or compression formats such as .tar or .tar.gz are not supported. The autograder will look for a code.zip file and if it does not find one, it will be unable to proceed. Please use code.zip
